# 🎉 Webhook Fixed!

## What Was Wrong

The webhook system had a **missing worker component**:

1. ✅ Webhooks were being received
2. ✅ Messages were being queued in Pub/Sub  
3. ❌ **No worker was processing the queue!**

## The Fix

Added a `/pubsub/process` endpoint that receives Pub/Sub push messages and processes them.

### Changes Made

1. **Added worker endpoint** (`app/main.py`):
   - New `/pubsub/process` POST endpoint
   - Receives Pub/Sub push messages
   - Processes sync jobs using `SyncWorker`

2. **Converted Pub/Sub subscription**:
   - Changed from PULL to PUSH mode
   - Points to: `https://todoist-notion-sync-769386743044.us-west1.run.app/pubsub/process`
   - Pub/Sub automatically delivers messages to the endpoint

3. **Deployed updated service**:
   - Built new Docker image
   - Deployed to Cloud Run
   - Reconfigured Pub/Sub subscription

## How It Works Now

```
Todoist Task Created
    ↓
Webhook → /todoist/webhook
    ↓
Publishes to Pub/Sub
    ↓
Pub/Sub PUSHES to → /pubsub/process (NEW!)
    ↓
SyncWorker processes job
    ↓
Task appears in Notion ✨
```

## Testing

Tested with simulated webhook:
- ✅ Message queued
- ✅ Pub/Sub delivered message
- ✅ Worker processed job
- ✅ Task "Another test" appeared in Notion

## Next Step

Create a real task in Todoist with `capsync` label and watch it sync automatically!

**Status**: 🟢 **FULLY WORKING**

The webhook automation is now complete and operational!
