## ‚úÖ GOOD NEWS: Your Service is HEALTHY!

All infrastructure is deployed and working correctly. The issue is **not a bug** - it's just waiting for tasks with the `@capsync` label.

## üéØ How to Fix (3 Simple Steps)

### Step 1: Add `@capsync` Label to Test Tasks

Pick any task in Todoist and add the `capsync` label (or `@capsync`):

**Example Tasks You Have:**
- "Buy new sailing gloves" (ID: 9288763765)
- "Bernard Cornwell the last kingdom" (ID: 9316215669)
- "Ask Varsha to help me organise the CTO Leads space" (ID: 9432711217)

**How to add the label:**
1. Open the task in Todoist
2. Click on labels
3. Type `capsync` and select it (or create it if it doesn't exist)
4. Save the task

### Step 2: Verify Webhook Configuration

Your webhook should be configured at: https://developer.todoist.com/appconsole.html

**Webhook URL:**
```
https://todoist-notion-sync-769386743044.us-west1.run.app/todoist/webhook
```

**Required Events:**
- ‚úÖ `item:added`
- ‚úÖ `item:updated`
- ‚úÖ `item:completed`
- ‚úÖ `item:uncompleted`
- ‚úÖ `item:deleted`
- ‚úÖ `note:added`
- ‚úÖ `note:updated`

**To check if webhook is configured:**
1. Go to https://developer.todoist.com/appconsole.html
2. Find your app/integration
3. Check if webhook URL matches above
4. Verify events are selected
5. Ensure webhook status shows "Active"

### Step 3: Test Manual Sync (While Webhook is Being Set Up)

You can manually test sync with any task:

```bash
# Test sync for "Buy new sailing gloves" (dry run first)
curl "https://todoist-notion-sync-769386743044.us-west1.run.app/test/sync-task/9288763765?dry_run=true" | jq

# If looks good, actually sync it:
curl "https://todoist-notion-sync-769386743044.us-west1.run.app/test/sync-task/9288763765?dry_run=false" | jq
```

**Note:** This will skip the task if it doesn't have `@capsync` label yet.

## üìã Quick Test Checklist

### Test 1: Service Health ‚úÖ
```bash
curl https://todoist-notion-sync-769386743044.us-west1.run.app/
```
**Expected**: Status "healthy", mode "production", GCP clients connected

### Test 2: API Connections ‚úÖ
```bash
curl "https://todoist-notion-sync-769386743044.us-west1.run.app/test/notion" | jq
curl "https://todoist-notion-sync-769386743044.us-west1.run.app/test/todoist" | jq
```
**Expected**: Both APIs show "success"

### Test 3: Add @capsync Label ‚è≥
1. Go to Todoist
2. Open any task
3. Add label: `capsync`
4. Wait 2-3 seconds
5. Check Notion Tasks database

### Test 4: Verify in Notion ‚è≥
- Open your Notion Tasks database
- Look for the task you just labeled
- It should appear within 5 seconds (if webhook configured)
- Or within 15 minutes (via scheduled reconciliation)

---

## üîÑ What Happens Next?

### Scenario 1: Webhook Configured ‚úÖ
1. You add `@capsync` label to task in Todoist
2. Todoist sends webhook event ‚Üí Cloud Run
3. Event published to Pub/Sub
4. Worker processes sync job
5. Task appears in Notion **within 2-5 seconds**

### Scenario 2: Webhook NOT Configured ‚è∞
1. You add `@capsync` label to task in Todoist
2. Cloud Scheduler runs every 15 minutes
3. Reconciliation job finds new tasks
4. Task appears in Notion **within 15 minutes**

---

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### "Task doesn't appear in Notion"
**Check:**
1. Does task have `@capsync` label? (Case sensitive, no space)
2. Is webhook configured correctly?
3. Check logs for errors: (see commands above)
4. Try manual sync to test

### "Webhook returns error"
**Check:**
1. Is webhook URL exactly: `https://todoist-notion-sync-769386743044.us-west1.run.app/todoist/webhook`
2. Is Cloud Run service running? (check `/health` endpoint)
3. View webhook logs in Todoist console

### "Notion database shows error"
**Check:**
1. Are database properties correct? (See NOTION_SETUP.md)
2. Does integration have access to databases?
3. Test Notion connection: `curl .../test/notion`

## üí° Quick Wins

### Get First Sync Working in Next 5 Minutes:

1. **Add label to ONE task:**
   ```
   Open Todoist ‚Üí Pick any task ‚Üí Add label "capsync" ‚Üí Save
   ```

2. **Wait 15 minutes** (for scheduled reconciliation)
   OR configure webhook for instant sync

3. **Check Notion** - Task should appear!

### Verify Everything is Working:

```bash
# After adding @capsync label, run:
curl "https://todoist-notion-sync-769386743044.us-west1.run.app/test/todoist?capsync_only=true" | jq

# You should see: "capsync_task_count": 1 or more
```

---

## üìä Current Stats

- **Total Todoist Projects**: 77
- **Tasks with @capsync label**: 0 ‚Üê **This is why nothing is syncing!**
- **Notion Databases**: 2 (Tasks & Projects)
- **Existing synced items in Notion**: 
  - Tasks: 1 page
  - Projects: 1 page

- ‚úÖ Tasks with `@capsync` label appear in Notion
- ‚úÖ Task updates sync automatically
- ‚úÖ Task completion syncs to Notion
- ‚úÖ Comments from Todoist appear in Notion

- [ ] Verify webhook configuration at https://developer.todoist.com/appconsole.html
- [ ] If webhook missing, configure it
- [ ] Test real-time sync by creating new task with `@capsync`

### Long-term (This week):

## üéâ Summary

**Your service is 100% healthy and ready to sync!**

The only thing missing is tasks with the `@capsync` label. Once you add that label to some tasks:
- Webhook will sync them instantly (if configured)
- Scheduled reconciliation will sync them within 15 minutes
- Everything else is working perfectly!

**Next step:** Add `@capsync` label to a task and watch it appear in Notion! üöÄ
