# Changes Summary - October 28, 2025

## üéØ Overview

This document summarizes all code changes, fixes, and improvements made on October 28, 2025. These changes align the codebase with the documented sync rules in `SYNC_RULES.md`.

---

## ‚úÖ **Fixes Implemented**

### üî¥ **CRITICAL Fixes**

#### 1. AREAS Auto-Creation Disabled
- **Issue:** `ensure_area_exists()` was creating areas automatically, violating sync rules and causing duplicate entries
- **Fix:** Modified to return `None` if area not found instead of creating
- **Files Changed:**
  - `app/notion_client.py` (lines 568-599)
- **Impact:** Prevents future duplicate AREAS creation
- **Note:** Existing duplicates should be cleaned up using `scripts/cleanup_duplicate_areas.py`

#### 2. Bidirectional Title Sync Removed
- **Issue:** Task titles were syncing Notion ‚Üí Todoist, contradicting "Todoist always wins" rule
- **Fix:** Removed task title sync from `_reconcile_notion_to_todoist()`
- **Files Changed:**
  - `app/handlers.py` (lines 373-412)
- **Impact:** Task properties are now strictly one-way (Todoist ‚Üí Notion)
- **Note:** Project names remain bidirectional (Notion wins post-creation)

---

### üü† **HIGH PRIORITY Fixes**

#### 3. Inbox Project Filtering
- **Issue:** Inbox project could sync to Notion, causing clutter
- **Fix:** Added check to skip Inbox project in `_ensure_project_exists()`
- **Files Changed:**
  - `app/pubsub_worker.py` (lines 341-369, 201-208)
- **Impact:** Inbox project and its tasks never sync to Notion

#### 4. Multiple Areas Support
- **Issue:** Tasks/projects could only sync first area, not all matching areas
- **Fix:**
  - Added `extract_para_areas()` function (returns list)
  - Updated task/project creation to accept list of area IDs
  - Modified Notion client methods to handle multiple relations
- **Files Changed:**
  - `app/utils.py` (lines 93-153)
  - `app/pubsub_worker.py` (lines 210-224, 267-279)
  - `app/notion_client.py` (create/update methods)
- **Impact:** Multi-area tasks/projects now fully supported

#### 5. Project AREAS Inheritance from Tasks
- **Issue:** Projects inherited area from only one task
- **Fix:** Added `_get_project_areas()` method to aggregate unique areas from all project tasks
- **Files Changed:**
  - `app/pubsub_worker.py` (lines 433-485)
- **Impact:** Projects now capture all relevant areas from their tasks

#### 6. Project AREAS Set Once at Creation
- **Issue:** Project areas were updated on every sync, overwriting Notion edits
- **Fix:** Modified `_ensure_project_exists()` to skip area updates for existing projects
- **Files Changed:**
  - `app/pubsub_worker.py` (lines 376-397)
  - `app/notion_client.py` (update_project_page with None check)
- **Impact:** Project areas are now Notion-controlled after initial creation

---

### üü° **MEDIUM PRIORITY Fixes**

#### 7. Two Notion Links (Task + Project)
- **Issue:** Only task link was added to Todoist, not project link
- **Fix:** Updated `_add_notion_backlink()` to add both links with separator
- **Files Changed:**
  - `app/pubsub_worker.py` (lines 487-540)
- **Impact:** Better UX - users can navigate to both task and project from Todoist
- **Format:**
  ```
  ---
  üìù View Task in Notion: [link]
  üìÅ View Project in Notion: [link]
  ```

#### 8. Auto-remove `capsync` Label
- **Issue:** Label was only added, never removed when task became recurring/moved to Inbox
- **Fix:**
  - Enhanced `_auto_label_tasks()` to remove labels from ineligible tasks
  - Added `remove_label_from_task()` method to Todoist client
- **Files Changed:**
  - `app/handlers.py` (lines 151-247)
  - `app/todoist_client.py` (lines 286-321)
- **Impact:** Tasks that become recurring or move to Inbox automatically lose capsync label

---

## üìù **Code Improvements**

### Removed Unused Code
- Removed `_area_locks` and `_locks_lock` from `NotionClient.__init__` (no longer needed)
- Removed `_get_area_lock()` method (obsolete after disabling auto-creation)
- Removed unused `asyncio` import from `notion_client.py`

### Enhanced Logging
- Added detailed logging for area lookups (warnings when area not found)
- Added logging for auto-unlabeling operations
- Added logging for Inbox project filtering
- Added logging for project area aggregation

### Documentation Improvements
- Updated all docstrings to reflect sync rules
- Added "Per sync rules:" comments to clarify design decisions
- Added warnings to deprecated functions (e.g., `extract_para_area()`)

---

## üß™ **Testing Recommendations**

### Manual Testing Checklist
1. ‚úÖ Create task in non-Inbox project ‚Üí verify capsync auto-added
2. ‚úÖ Move task to Inbox ‚Üí verify capsync auto-removed
3. ‚úÖ Toggle task recurring ‚Üí verify capsync auto-removed
4. ‚úÖ Create task with multiple area labels ‚Üí verify all areas sync
5. ‚úÖ Create project with mixed-area tasks ‚Üí verify all areas aggregate
6. ‚úÖ Edit task title in Notion ‚Üí verify Todoist NOT updated
7. ‚úÖ Edit project name in Notion ‚Üí verify Todoist IS updated
8. ‚úÖ Edit project areas in Notion ‚Üí verify no overwrite on next sync
9. ‚úÖ Check Todoist task description ‚Üí verify two Notion links present
10. ‚úÖ Verify Inbox tasks never appear in Notion

### Unit Tests to Update
- `test_extract_para_areas_multiple()` - Multi-area extraction
- `test_ensure_area_exists_no_create()` - Verify no auto-creation
- `test_auto_remove_capsync_recurring()` - Label removal logic
- `test_inbox_filter()` - Inbox project skipping
- `test_multi_area_task_sync()` - End-to-end multi-area
- `test_project_areas_from_tasks()` - Project area aggregation
- `test_two_notion_links()` - Description formatting

---

## üö® **Breaking Changes**

### 1. AREAS Must Be Pre-Created
**Before:** Sync auto-created missing areas  
**After:** Sync logs warning and skips relation if area doesn't exist  
**Action Required:** Manually create all 7 PARA areas in Notion AREAS DB first

### 2. Task Title Sync Removed
**Before:** Editing task title in Notion synced back to Todoist  
**After:** Only Todoist ‚Üí Notion sync for task titles  
**Impact:** Minimal (aligns with documented "Todoist wins" rule)

### 3. Project AREAS Become Notion-Controlled
**Before:** Project areas updated on every sync  
**After:** Project areas set once at creation, then Notion-controlled  
**Impact:** Positive - allows manual area management in Notion
